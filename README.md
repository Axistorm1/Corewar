# üî• Corewar: The Battle of Code

**Corewar** is a programming game where players write programs, called **warriors**, that battle for control of a simulated computer memory called the **core**. The game is a test of logic, strategy, and low-level programming skill.

---

## üß† How It Works

- **Language**: Warriors are written in an assembly-like language called **Redcode** (this version uses a pseudo-redcode language).
- **Simulator**: The game runs in a virtual machine that follows the rules of the **MARS** (Memory Array Redcode Simulator).
- **Goal**: Each warrior tries to:
  - Survive longest in the memory.
  - Crash or disable the opponent's code.
  - Take over the memory by replicating or overwriting other programs.

---

## üíª Game Mechanics

- The core memory is a circular array where each cell can contain a Redcode instruction.
- Multiple warriors are loaded into different parts of the core.
- Warriors execute instructions based on their 'cooldown'.
- If a warrior runs out of processes, it dies.
- The last warrior running wins.
